The Tropy webinar for graduate students is coming up this Friday, October 9 at 11:00am EDT. We’ve had a lot of grad student interest in this session, and registration is now full. Here are some links to resources that will be discussed during the session:

- Tropy [user manual](https://docs.tropy.org/): start by reading the user manual before you begin using Tropy
- Tropy [forums](https://forums.tropy.org/): a good place to ask a question that’s not covered in the documentation (after you’ve fully read the documentation, of course!)
- [Digital Public Library of America](https://dp.la/) & [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/en): examples of content aggregators that will help you search for digital source material
- [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/): a tool to collect and organize your secondary sources
- Subscribe to the Tropy [newsletter](https://buttondown.email/tropy) for updates and resources
- Follow Tropy on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tropy)

If you’re not able to attend the webinar live, don’t worry! The session will be recorded. Look out for the video, which will be posted on the Tropy [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ3QCuNGz825BGSHG9JryeA) in the coming days.

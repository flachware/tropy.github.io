We are delighted to announce the release of Tropy 1.1!

This update to Tropy provides more features that you can customize to fit your workflow. Of particular note is our new experimental export plugin, which allows you to export items (including their photos) into [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/), RRCHNM’s next-generation web-publishing platform for sharing digital collections and creating media-rich online exhibits.

## New global features

* SVG support: Tropy now supports JPG, PNG, and SVG file formats.

* [New languages](https://docs.tropy.org/preferencesmd.html): Tropy is now available in French, German, and Japanese, thanks to translation efforts from our team and from volunteers. Thanks especially to Nobuhiko Kikuchi for our Japanese translation!

* [Export to Omeka S](https://docs.tropy.org/omeka.html): A beta version of our export plugin to Omeka is now available. This export allows you to connect your research work to your public-facing projects with ease. Omeka S is the new version of RRCHNM’s widely used web-publishing platform, rebuilt to allow a shareable resource pool to be used across multiple sites, and to facilitate the publication of items with linked open data. The plugin does not export to Omeka Classic or Omeka.net.

## New item view features

* [Enhanced image editing](https://docs.tropy.org/using_tropy/item_view/photo-editing.html): You can now adjust a variety of controls to allow you to clarify your photos. You can change brightness, contrast, hue, and saturation. You can even invert the colors of your photos (to help reading sources such as microfilm negatives).

* [More note-taking options](https://docs.tropy.org/using_tropy/item_view/notes.html): You can now use vertical writing, include line numbers, and turn off line wrap.

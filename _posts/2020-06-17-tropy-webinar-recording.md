We held our first Tropy webinar on June 16, 2020, and it was a success! If you couldn't make it, that's ok. We have made a recording available of the unedited session [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/jWjP90EWHkQ).

We'd also like your feedback about what online training you might want from us in the future; feel free to leave us a comment on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tropy) or on the [forums](https://forums.tropy.org/). We've considered many different options, including more discipline-specific training or training about a particular part of Tropy that you're interested in, so tell us what you want!

Also, please sign up for [our newsletter](https://buttondown.email/tropy) so you can be apprised of any future events.

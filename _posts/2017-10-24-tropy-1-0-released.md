We are pleased to announce that the 1.0 release of Tropy is now available. While our crack team of developers continues to refine the software and add new features, Tropy is now officially out of its beta testing phase. If you haven't yet tried Tropy, now is the perfect time to try this new tool for working with your archival research photos.

Anyone upgrading to Tropy 1.0 from earlier betas should download the latest version from [Tropy's homepage](https://tropy.org). You'll find significant improvements in functionality and stability. Because Tropy now automatically checks for new versions, you won't need to worry about remaining up to date going forward.

We would like to thank the [Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](https://mellon.org) for funding Tropy, and also thank our users who have already contributed essential bug reports and feature suggestions. With your support, we are well on our way to transforming the way researchers work with archives.

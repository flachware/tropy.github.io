Train the Trainers is coming to Washington, DC (or really, to Fairfax, VA)! We'll be convening on our home turf, George Mason University, to do two sessions, one for librarians/archivists, and one for faculty, as outlined [here](https://tropy.org/blog/training-you-to-teach-tropy/).

Bring a laptop so you can play along! These workshops are free, but we do ask you to register so we know how many are coming.

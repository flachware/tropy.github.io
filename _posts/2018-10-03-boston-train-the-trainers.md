The Tropy team is pleased to announce the first of our Train the Trainers workshops, to be held **at Northeastern University on November 13**.

We invite librarians, archivists, and faculty members from across the Boston area to join us as we talk about how to teach Tropy to others.

We will be holding two separate workshops, one for librarians and archivists, and one for faculty members. (Make sure you sign up for the right one!)

**You don't need any digital experience to attend these workshops.** You don't even have to use Tropy yourself. But if you ever teach anyone about research methods or research tools, this workshop is for you.


## The Details
